# LearnEasy

Hello World! We would like to introduce you to a new, fun, and easy way of learning. Educate your child in a fun way by playing games, interacting with visuals, and chatting with others. We have created many games, and visuals for your child to excel in their learning.

## 💡 Inspiration

- Make education fun for children online
- Learn valuable skills with gaming
- Broaden the knownledge skills of the users
- Broaden the amount of users, have a different language option

## 💻 How it Works?

- Head on over to the website and view the options
- Login using authenication
- Choose from a variety of topics
- Play games, study from interactive visuals, or chat with other kids
- If it is more useful for you, you can change the language input to match the one you want

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Frontend: React JS, Tailwind
- Backend: Firebase
- Multiple languages: i18n
- GitHub: Collaboration, Hosting and Deployment
- Tools: Git

## 🤝 Most Creative Use of GitHub

- When using GitHub we implemented the **CI/CD workflow** and made the deployment process easy. It helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.
- **Deploying** the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.
- We are using GitHub for **Collaboration**. GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration. GitHub makes it easy to set up a project and get started.
- We also used GitHub for planning and keeping track of our project and its progress with the help of the **GitHub project** management tool.

## ⛅ Best Use of Google Cloud

Our application uses Firebase for the database to store chats and to authenticate users. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable real-time, high-performance database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firebase is a free service and easy to use and has sped up our development process significantly.

## 🌐 Best Domain Name from Domain.com (If we can do)

- Register any .tech domain name from Domain.com.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- The biggest challenge was the differece in time zones. But we collaborated and made the project complete in given time frame.
- Another challange was to implement the multi-language option. We had to use the **i18n** to pass the language option to the components.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the Project in such a short time frame.
- Creating a website that is easy to use, looks great, and can help someone learn

## 📖 What we learned

- Using i18n.
- Deploying web app on GitHub Pages.
- Efficient use of GitHub actions.

## 🚀 What's next for LearnEasy

- Building a mobile app
- Adding more fun educational games, and visuals
- Adding more languages
